An ounce up your bum is handled in the liver the same as an ounce down the hatch. However, there are a lot of safety mechanisms built into the normal way of consuming alcohol that protect you before the alcohol ever gets to the liver. First step is the mouth. We have a strong sense for bitter things, and it evolved specifically to detect poisons like alcohol. Most people have a difficult time drinking strong alcohol, the taste alone can cause nauseousness or vomiting which will discourage drinking a lethal amount. If you do manage to drink too much, the next step is the stomach. Once you start to feel sick, the stomach is still holding a lot of unabsorbed alcohol that is safely eliminated once it's vomited. If all that fails and you get taken to a hospital, they'll feed you activated charcoal that will absorb the alcohol before you do and safely pass it in your stool.  \n  \nYou can inhale a bathtub full of malt-liquor or butt-chug an entire bottle of whiskey without much repugnance, and once you do that's it. It's in you for good until it's either metabolized or it kills you, strong likelihood of the latter. If you try it the old fashioned way, you're going to have a difficult time getting it down quickly and a more difficult time keeping it down.  \n  \nTL/DR: Inhaling or butt-chugging alcohol is very dangerous, not because it bypasses the liver but because it bypasses your natural aversion, your ability to vomit excessive amounts out, and eliminates options for medical intervention.", "replies": [{"id": "j22hkg1", "body": "so you're saying there's no scenario where a medical professional is depositing active charcoal in a rectum with a turkey baster or fluid syringe?", "replies": [{"id": "j22jn72", "body": "Some types of professionals will do that, but I don't think they have medical degrees", "replies": []}]}]}, {"id": "j22h2e3", "body": "I remember a girl in high school soaked her tampon in liquor and put it in and was hospitalized.", "replies": []}]}, {"id": "j21wlgr", "body": "All I can think about is The Liquor Snurf \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "replies": [{"id": "j225owc", "body": "BLULIAN", "replies": []}]}]}, {"id": "j217bm1", "body": "Err day", "replies": []}]}, {"id": "j223c24", "body": "At one point? \n\nHe's been battling alcoholism for like 20 years and is still losing to it hardcore.

He wrote a book \"Too Fat To Fish\" and he describes his experience with him and Kelly Preston...\n\nhttps://forums.mixedmartialarts.com/t/artie-lange-describes-working-with-tom-cruise/2703034\n\n\"...I booked a small part in Jerry Maguire and shot a scene with Tom Cruise and Kelly Preston, both of whom were total douchebags. It was the scene in which their two characters break up and she punches him in the face. It's at the NFL Draft, and I play an annoying radio guy who interrupts this moment they're having and says \"Hey, Jerry, good to see you! Tom Jackson from WHDZ here. Are you going to the Big Tequila volleyball tournament later? It's gonna be great!\" Then Tom Cruise gives me a fuck-off look, I pause, realize that I am being an asshole, and kind of creep away. It was funny, awkward, jokey moment in that scene that didn't make it. \nIt probably would have been a forgettable moment, but what I'll never forget is how fucking insanely rude Tom Cruise and Kelly Preston were. This is before he started couch jumping, but let me tell you, that guy Cruise was already nuttier than a fruitcake. He had this thing about getting his energy to the perfect place before he did a scene, and he would ramp up by jumping rope. He had some guy, who was on the payroll for the film, standing there holding his jump rope off set. Cruise would jump rope with that insane grin of his face until he was ready, then he'd signal to Cameron Crowe, toss his rope, step in the scene, Crowe would yell \"Action,\" and Cruise would go right into it. It was incredibly distracting--and I only had two fucking lines to say to the guy! While I was standing there watching this nonsense, I kept wondering what the fuck he did to ramp up for a love scene.\n\nAnyway, we did the scene maybe twenty times, and even though I was standing literally five feet from those two, once Cameron Crowe stopped the scene and the production guys went about moving the cameras and stuff, which would take anywhere from two to twenty minutes, neither of those fuckers would acknowledge my existence. No eye contact, nothing. I tried to make small talk, and Kelly Preston acted like she didn't hear me. And it's not like either of them was playing some difficult character where they couldn't break their focus. Please, they were reciting lines, that was it. Neither one is Laurence Olivier. I did almost punch Tom Cruise, which I probably should have-- it might have knocked some sense into that lunatic. I've always shown respect for my writers and their hard work by making sure that when I perform anything, I do the script as written. Particularly in a big-budget movie directed by a guy as cool as Cameron Crowe, I made damn sure that I had my lines memorized correctly. \n\nNow, Cruise is the kind if guy who likes to change the dialogue that morning in the makeup chair with no regard for anyone, from the director to the screenwriter to anybody else in the world, who on average are probably a lot smarter than he is. So Cruise had changed what he was going to say and how he was going to play the scene and no one had informed me. Whatever I was doing by sticking to the script was severely going against his pacing, and judging by the whole jumping-rope bullshit, pacing was a big deal to that nutjob. We did a few takes and on each one he seemed to be getting more and more steamed, but he wouldn't look me in the eye or talk to me between takes to tell me what the problem was. He'd only talk to Cameron and say things like: \"Cameron, that take was off, the timing is wrong.\"\nFinally, he just exploded. He looked at me and screamed, \"Can you come in quicker, please?!\" Everyone got real quiet and looked at me in disgust.\n\nCameron called for a break and pulled me aside.\n\"Listen, man, it's not you,\" he said. \"You're doing it exactly as written. Let me go talk to him. He changed his part, so doing it according to the script is throwing him off. You're doing a great job. Just come in quicker, and it'll all be okay.\"\n\n\"Of course, no problem,\" I said. \"I wish I'd known. I'm so sorry I upset him.\" Not too sorry to punch his fucking dumb grin into the back of his head, however.\n\nOnce Cameron got Tom back on set, we did the scene according to Tom's invisible pacing mater and that was it, I was done.\n\nWhat a legendary moment in my acting career. To Cruise's credit, at the end of the take he yelled, \"Thank you!\" at me.\nKelly Preston wasn't any better. She chit-chatted with Tom between takes, but I might as well have been a tree with a pile of dogshit at the base of it.

I think it's sort of an association thing for women (I don't really believe in human pheromones, but this would be another explanation). It's kind of like how weed and tobacco both smell awful, but if you are a stoner it ends up being one of your favorite smells. But \"bad\" B.O. still always smells bad, just like how stale cigarette smoke and actual skunks still smell bad even though they are similar. \n\nThat said not long afterwards I gained about 30-40 lbs and got really stressed out and overworked. My smell got really bad really quick, and dipped into the bad B.O. category and now I bathe twice a day most of the time.\n\nI think the best trick though was salt water.

It was decent, nothing I hadn\u2019t heard from elsewhere but I thought he did well. \n\nBut the other stuff I\u2019ve seen from him, he seems to equal masculinity with success, with wealth and muscles and the opportunity to sleep with loads of different women, and he seems unable to grasp that that\u2019s a very narrow view of humans in general and men in particular. I feel like the view of masculinity he presents boxes men in, limits and emasculates men, narrows their\u2026 everything, everything a man can be. The only thing left is this very narrow lane of acceptable manliness. In short, I think he dumbs men down and strips them of their masculinity, ironically enough. \n\nIncidentally, he also makes men out to be very fragile and snowflake-y, because criticism of this narrow view of what masculinity is seems to be taken as an attack on men and masculinity, when it\u2019s quite literally the opposite, a defense of masculinity. \n\nAlso, what IS it with his hard-on for cars? I mean, I\u2019m all for a nerdy man, give me the nerds, but when his reply to detractors include \u201dI have a Bugatti and you don\u2019t\u201d he just shows himself to be continually wooshed. Come on, man. Grow up. (Hence me likening him to my young nephew because he employs similiar strategies of defence.)\n\nAs for his view on women, it\u2019s similarly narrow and he does not seem to have actually have had (nor want to have) an actual mutually respectful relationship, just glorified fuckbuddies. Which is fine, but he\u2019s missing out on experiences that he nonetheless keeps talking about like he\u2019s some sort of expert. \n\nI could say more but this is already too long. \n\nIn short, don\u2019t be Andrew Tate - be MORE than Andrew Tate because he\u2019s too limited.\n\nEdit: and for fuck\u2019s sake when I say more, I do NOT mean richer, fitter or own more cars.
